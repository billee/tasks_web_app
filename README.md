Great! Here are my implementation ideas for the "Email Tasks" feature with LLM email tools:

Architecture Overview:
1. Tool Selection System
Context-aware tool loading - When "Email Tasks" is selected, load email-specific tools
Tool registry/factory pattern - Dynamically register and instantiate email tools
Tool categorization - Group tools by functionality (read, compose, search, manage, etc.)
2. Email Tools Categories:
Email Reading Tools:
Read inbox messages
Get specific email by ID
Search emails by criteria (sender, subject, date range)
Get email thread/conversation
Extract attachments info
Email Composition Tools:
Draft new email
Reply to email
Forward email
Add recipients (CC, BCC)
Attach files
Email Management Tools:
Mark as read/unread
Archive emails
Delete emails
Move to folders/labels
Flag/star emails
Create filters/rules
Email Analysis Tools:
Categorize emails (urgent, spam, personal, work)
Extract action items from emails
Summarize email threads
Sentiment analysis
Extract contact information
3. Implementation Structure:
Backend Components:
Tool registry system - Register available email tools
Email service layer - Abstract email provider interactions (Gmail, Outlook)
Tool execution engine - Handle tool calls from LLM
Permission/auth system - Manage email access permissions
Frontend Components:
Tool selection UI - Switch between general chat and email tasks
Email context display - Show current email being processed
Tool execution feedback - Display what email actions are being performed
Email preview/results - Show email content and actions taken
4. LLM Integration:
Tool Definition System:
JSON schema definitions - Define each email tool's parameters and responses
Function calling integration - Connect LLM function calls to actual email operations
Context management - Maintain email session state across conversations
Error handling - Graceful handling of email API failures
Conversation Flow:
User selects "Email Tasks" mode
LLM gets access to email tool definitions
User makes email-related requests
LLM decides which email tools to use
Backend executes email operations
Results returned to user with confirmation
5. Files That Would Be Affected:
Backend Files:
New: backend/app/email_tools/ directory structure
New: backend/app/tools/email_registry.py
Modify: backend/app/ai_client.py - Add tool selection logic
Modify: backend/app/main.py - Add email tools endpoints
Extend: backend/app/email_client.py - Add more email operations
Frontend Files:
Modify: frontend/src/components/ChatInterface/ - Add tool selection
New: frontend/src/components/EmailTools/ - Email-specific UI components
Modify: frontend/src/services/llm.js - Handle email tool responses
New: frontend/src/services/emailTools.js - Email tool API calls
6. User Experience Flow:
Mode Selection - User clicks "Email Tasks" button/toggle
Tool Loading - System loads email tools and updates LLM context
Natural Language - User asks "Show me urgent emails from today"
Tool Execution - LLM calls email search tool with appropriate parameters
Results Display - Email list shown with actions available
Follow-up Actions - User can ask to reply, archive, etc.
7. Security Considerations:
OAuth token management - Secure email provider authentication
Permission scoping - Limit email access based on user permissions
Audit logging - Track all email operations performed
Rate limiting - Prevent abuse of email APIs
This approach provides a flexible, extensible system where email tools can be easily added and the LLM can intelligently choose which tools to use based on user requests.
